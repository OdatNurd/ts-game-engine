This is a simple game "engine" (I use that term loosely) written in TypeScript
for creating game prototypes.

This code is in no way meant for production type games; rather, I use it in my
game development explorations. Although I could in fact prototype games a lot
faster with things like Unity or GameMaker: Studio, this is meant more for
getting the hang of all of the parts that those game engines do for you, for a
learning experience.

This code originated from my explorations with Devember 2015. See
<http://devember.org> for information on Devember and in particular my GitLab
project associated with it, <https://gitlab.com/OdatNurd/devember-2015> with my
associated blog at <http://bloggity.nurdz.com/category/gamedev/devember2015/>.

The basis of this project is the engine branch from that project, which means
that this contains all of the commits to the core engine that were made during
Devember but not any of the commits (or history) of Rx, the Dr. Mario clone
that I prototyped during Devember. (Note: I accidentally checked in a Wav file
for the sample music; this copy of the repository has that particular error
fixed).

This code is licensed with the MIT license, so feel free to use it for whatever
purpose you like.
